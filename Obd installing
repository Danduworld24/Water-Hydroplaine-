------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation of Features:
Water Detection: The code continuously monitors for water detection. When water is detected, it immediately calculates the speed and water depth and generates an alert based on these values.
Real-Time Monitoring: The main loop continuously checks the conditions every 5 seconds. This can be adjusted based on your requirements.
Voice Alerts: The system uses text-to-speech to provide real-time voice alerts to the driver.
Automatic Feature Activation: The feature is automatically activated when water is detected and deactivated when no water is present.
Safe Journey Message: When no water is detected, the system provides a "Road is clear. Have a safe journey." message and stops alerting.
Hydroplaning Alert: A specific alert with the message "Don't apply Brake" is given when the conditions meet the hydroplaning risk criteria.
This code ensures all features work together in real-time, providing immediate responses to changes in road conditions.
