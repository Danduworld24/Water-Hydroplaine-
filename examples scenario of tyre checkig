In the code provided above, the water depth levels are used to determine the tire contact and hydroplaning risks. Here are the key depth levels and their meanings:

Water Depth Levels and Conditions:
Full road contact (Safe Conditions):

Speed: Less than 60 km/h
Water depth: Less than 5 mm
Tire contact: 100% (Full contact with the road)
Condition: When the vehicle is traveling slowly (under 60 km/h) and there is minimal water (under 5 mm), the tires maintain full contact with the road. Itâ€™s safe to drive in these conditions.
Reduced road contact (Moderate Risk):

Speed: Between 60 and 80 km/h
Water depth: Less than 15 mm
Tire contact: 50% to 100%
Condition: When the vehicle is traveling at moderate speeds (60-80 km/h) and the water depth is moderate (5 mm to 15 mm), the tires start to lose contact with the road. There is a moderate risk, and the vehicle needs to slow down to reduce the risk of hydroplaning.
Hydroplaning Risk:

Speed: More than 80 km/h
Water depth: 15 mm or more
Tire contact: Less than 50%
Condition: At higher speeds (over 80 km/h) with significant water depth (15 mm or more), the tires have less than 50% contact with the road, creating a high risk of hydroplaning. The vehicle should slow down to prevent hydroplaning, and a "Don't apply Brake" warning is issued.
Summary of Water Depth Conditions:
Under 5 mm: Safe to drive with full tire contact.
5 mm to 15 mm: Moderate risk with reduced tire contact (speed between 60 and 80 km/h).
15 mm or more: High risk of hydroplaning, with reduced tire contact at speeds over 80 km/h.
These depth levels are critical for determining the road conditions and advising the driver accordingly based on the vehicle's speed and tire contact with the road.
