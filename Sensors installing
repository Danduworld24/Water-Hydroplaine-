Explanation:
Water Detection Sensor Integration:

The water_detection_sensor function simulates the detection of water on the road.
If water is detected, the system proceeds to measure the water depth and check the weather conditions.
Automatic Activation:

When water is detected and the conditions are met, the relevant features are activated automatically.
Automatic Deactivation:

If no water is detected, the system provides a safe journey message and stops the alerts and voice notifications.
Real-Time Scenario Implementation:
Speed Sensor: Mounted on the wheels or integrated into the vehicleâ€™s OBD-II system to monitor speed continuously.
Water Detection Sensors: Capacitance or conductive water sensors mounted near the tires to detect the presence of water.
Water Depth Sensor: Ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors mounted underneath the vehicle to measure the depth of water.
Rain Sensor: Optical or capacitive sensors mounted on the windshield to detect rain.
Weather Data API: Integrated to provide real-time weather conditions.
By using these sensors and integrating them into the vehicle's onboard system, you can create a robust system that automatically activates and deactivates features based on real-time road and weather conditions.
