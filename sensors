To detect when water touches the tires and automatically trigger the features, you can use capacitance-based water sensors or conductive water sensors. These sensors can be installed near the tires to detect the presence of water. When water is detected, they can send a signal to the vehicle's onboard system to activate the relevant features. Here’s how you can implement these sensors in a real-time working scenario:

Types of Sensors:
Capacitance-Based Water Sensors:

Type: Capacitance water level sensor.
Function: Detects the presence of water by measuring changes in capacitance.
Placement: Mounted near the tires, close to the road surface.
Conductive Water Sensors:

Type: Conductive water level sensor.
Function: Detects the presence of water by measuring changes in electrical conductivity.
Placement: Mounted near the tires, close to the road surface.
Integration with the System:
Capacitance-Based Water Sensor Integration:

These sensors detect the presence of water by sensing the change in capacitance when water is present.
They are highly sensitive and can detect even small amounts of water.
Conductive Water Sensor Integration:

These sensors detect water by sensing the change in conductivity when water forms a bridge between two conductive probes.
They are simple to use and reliable for detecting water presence.
Workflow:
Install the Sensors:

Mount the capacitance-based or conductive water sensors near each tire, close to the road surface.
Connect to the Vehicle's Onboard System:

Connect the sensors to the vehicle’s onboard system using appropriate interfaces (e.g., analog or digital input ports).
Sensor Activation:

When water is detected, the sensor sends a signal to the onboard system to activate the relevant features automatically.
System Response:

The system checks water depth, tire contact, speed, and weather conditions.
Alerts and voice notifications are triggered based on the detected conditions.
