Key Features:
Automatic Water Detection: The code checks for water depth whenever the water touches the tires.
Automatic Weather Check: The code simulates a weather check to see if it's raining.
Automatic Tire Contact Calculation: Automatically calculates tire contact based on speed and water depth.
Automatic Alert System: Issues appropriate alerts based on conditions.
Automatic Voice Alerts: Uses text-to-speech for alert messages.
Automatic Icon Blinking: Blinks a danger symbol if there's a hydroplaning risk.
Automatic Safe Journey Message: Stops alerting and provides a safe journey message when no water is detected on the road.
